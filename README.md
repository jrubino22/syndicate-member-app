 A production membership app I built that handles a wholesale membership program. This app seemlessly integrates with Shopify to
 allow customers to sign up and view membership status from their account in the wholesale site. Company employees use this app
 directly in the Shopify admin in order to edit or delete memberships. This was built using Koa, Next.JS, and MongoDB.
